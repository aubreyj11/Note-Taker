## Description
This project's purpose is to give users a place to input notes and save them to a list. My motivation to build this project was to make an application that gives users a place to store the notes they need to remember. This app solves the problem of needing to remember things on a list because everything can be kept in one spot. I learned through making this application that relative paths and setting them up correctly is very important and can break the website if not done correctly.

## Installation
After cloning the code from the repository or using the Heroku website link, make sure that Express, Node, and all dependencies are downloaded. In the server.js file terminal window, run 'node server.js' to start server in the local server at port 3001. Listed below is a link to the deployed Heroku application:

## Usage
Run the application and click the Get Started button to be brought to the notes page. Once a note has a title and text content, a save button will appear in the top right corner for the user to save the note with the title and text. Users can then go back and view their saved notes on the left side of the page by simply clicking on the title of the note they would like to view.
