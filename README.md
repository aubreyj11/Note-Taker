This project's purpose is to give users a place to input notes and save them to a list. My motivation to build this project was to make an application that gives users a place to store the notes they need to remember. This app solves the problem of needing to remember things on a list because everything can be kept in one spot. I learned through making this application that relative paths and setting them up correctly is very important and can break the website if not done correctly.
